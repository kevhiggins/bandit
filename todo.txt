-Only allow bandit gobbling when stationary

Next Phase:
Abstract merchatns to travelers
Multiple moving bandits
Merchants using A*

-Fix hitbox on towns/merchants, so that they don't disappear as quickly as they do?
-Instead of modifying the waypoint code directly, consider creating an observer class that automatically looks through waypoints, and configures the click collider and node visual
-Allow disabling squares for waypointcluster editor

Add bandit to a starting node
leverage A* to move bandit on node click
If bandit intersects a merchant, then eat the merchant and increase score.
Remove ability to click merchants to increase score.

-Pull pathfinding library into nuget package
