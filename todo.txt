Deadline Thursday on Editor fun

-Setup canvas with world view and text subobject with animation
-Use GameObject spawn script
-Create a script that gets the animation duration on awake, and deletes the gameobject at the end.
-Change texthook to allow for one time update


-Way to create damage pops without being helpful
	Add last robbed value to texthook registry, and utilize the GameObject spawn
	
	
String value
Canvas Game objects
Text Game object
Animation?	
	

Bandit to soldier gold economy button/personal gold

Add more soldier behavior
Soldiers that kill bandits.

Creating/Destroying Bandits with our gold.


It seems to me that there is a delay when instantiating prefabs like particle effects/sounds for at least the first time.



https://www.nuget.org

Cannot start/stop particle effects arbitrarily in animator

Allow multiple text hooks

Make it so that we are linking the properties to the registry, instead of just calling a method.
This will help to ensure that the initial value of the property is always applied to the registry.

-Fix scoreboard
-scoreboard flashy

-Path to node where bandit was

Crime increments meters evenly for all towns
Travelers “belong” to a town, and increment their town of origin’s meter
Once meter fills, a soldier spawns and moves to the location of the node where the triggering crime happened.
If no bandit is found, path back home
Reset all gold if bandit is caught

Debug Gizmo for town / heat info





coin burst thing?

ParticleManager
ParticleAnchor for game objects


-Fix editor so prefabs aren't broken when cloning
=How much gold traveler is worth?

-Setup nuget repo for pathfinding, and use paket


-Instead of modifying the waypoint code directly, consider creating an observer class that automatically looks through waypoints, and configures the click collider and node visual
-Allow disabling squares for waypointcluster editor
-figure out a way to disable graph editor hit boxes while the game is running? They just make things more confusing.

-Look into not needing to find UI gameobject children by name.
