Next Phase:
Multiple moving bandits
Merchants using A*

X-Abstract merchatns to travelers
X-Only allow bandit gobbling when stationary
X-Fix hitbox on towns/merchants, so that they don't disappear as quickly as they do?
-Instead of modifying the waypoint code directly, consider creating an observer class that automatically looks through waypoints, and configures the click collider and node visual
-Allow disabling squares for waypointcluster editor

-Pull pathfinding library into nuget package
