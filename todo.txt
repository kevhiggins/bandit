-Fix editor so prefabs aren't broken when cloning

Next Phase:
X-Multiple moving bandits
-Merchants using A*
	-On spawn, roll dice between towns that aren't the one they spawned from, and go there.
-Allow the three different flavors of traveler


-Town prefab with spawn controls
	-spawn rate
	-List of destination towns
=How much gold traveler is worth?


X-Abstract merchatns to travelers
X-Only allow bandit gobbling when stationary
X-Fix hitbox on towns/merchants, so that they don't disappear as quickly as they do?
-Instead of modifying the waypoint code directly, consider creating an observer class that automatically looks through waypoints, and configures the click collider and node visual
-Allow disabling squares for waypointcluster editor
-figure out a way to disable graph editor hit boxes while the game is running? They just make things more confusing.

-Pull pathfinding library into nuget package

-TODO Find a good place to put helper method for adapting waypoint to IGraphNode
