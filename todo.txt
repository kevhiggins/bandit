Creating/Destroying Bandits with our gold.
Prevent robbing people in town.

Feedback on town when terror rising.
Coins pop out of bandit.
Bandits personal coin purse.


Waypoint Editor:
Low Priority - Half size gizmo boxes


Fancy Idea:
Look into the best way to configure particle effects on units. Should they all have them, or do we instantiate them using an anchor.
Animation/Particle hook thing similar to TextHook






https://www.nuget.org

Cannot start/stop particle effects arbitrarily in animator

Allow multiple text hooks

Make it so that we are linking the properties to the registry, instead of just calling a method.
This will help to ensure that the initial value of the property is always applied to the registry.

-Fix scoreboard
-scoreboard flashy

-Path to node where bandit was

Crime increments meters evenly for all towns
Travelers “belong” to a town, and increment their town of origin’s meter
Once meter fills, a soldier spawns and moves to the location of the node where the triggering crime happened.
If no bandit is found, path back home
Reset all gold if bandit is caught

Debug Gizmo for town / heat info





coin burst thing?

ParticleManager
ParticleAnchor for game objects


-Fix editor so prefabs aren't broken when cloning
=How much gold traveler is worth?

-Setup nuget repo for pathfinding, and use paket


-Instead of modifying the waypoint code directly, consider creating an observer class that automatically looks through waypoints, and configures the click collider and node visual
-Allow disabling squares for waypointcluster editor
-figure out a way to disable graph editor hit boxes while the game is running? They just make things more confusing.

-Look into not needing to find UI gameobject children by name.
