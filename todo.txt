Add OnMouseHover script to be used with colliders


OnStruck()
Add game object anchor placeholders for the units, and configure them on the BattleIllustrator (Change it to a monobehavior)
Also configure the unit text fields on the Battle Illustrator.


Issues:
Throwing our existing prefabs into a new scene is going to be wacky. We should have a separate prefab configured onto our Unit script specifically for the battle version of a unit.



Step 1:
Setup battle HUD
Unit threat number
Bandits have first initiative
Build statemachine for combat?


Attack
HP


Step 1:
Trigger an ambush
	-Put your guy in ambush mode
	-When a special merchant comes by, an ambush happens
	-Ambush button

Step 2:
How to pause the game



Step ?:
Add text log for combat actions




X-Way to group bandits into a party
Some form of stat system.
Setup GUI system with buttons and display area.
How do we layout the units on their side of the field
Programming button actions accordingly


Setup basic selection GUI with Ambush button.
Implement the 3 bandit states, and make sure they interact with the world accordingly.
That includes ambushing merchants (add a merchant script)



Bandit ambush state for robbing caravans specifically.
	-Simplest implementation is to get more gold than normal and drop out of the ambush state.
	-Bandits in ambush state can't be punished by soldiers.
	
	
	-Idle
	-Rob
	-Ambush
	
	Can't rob travelers, but can rob merchants?
	
	Pause world on ambush to determine if you want to fight
	
	
	cooldown

Add more soldier behavior

It seems to me that there is a delay when instantiating prefabs like particle effects/sounds for at least the first time.

Debug Gizmo for town / heat info

-Setup nuget repo for pathfinding, and use paket

Parking Lot:
-Instead of modifying the waypoint code directly, consider creating an observer class that automatically looks through waypoints, and configures the click collider and node visual
